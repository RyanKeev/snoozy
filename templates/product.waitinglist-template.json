That's why we set out to develop one pillow that can be adjusted to suit all sleeping positions.<\/p><p>After endless testing, we've designed the perfect pillow: one that gives everyone the right support, thanks to its adjustable functionality. A pillow that ensures you wake up rested and pain-free after a good night's sleep.<\/p><p><strong>Coming to the Philippines in November, 2023.<\/strong><\/p>"}},"loox-product-reviews-app-section":{"type":"apps","settings":{"include_margins":false}},"related-products":{"type":"related-products","disabled":true,"settings":{"heading":"You may also like","heading_size":"h2","products_to_show":4,"columns_desktop":4,"color_scheme":"background-1","image_ratio":"adapt","image_shape":"default","show_secondary_image":false,"show_vendor":false,"show_rating":false,"columns_mobile":"2","padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":68}}},"order":["0cd25557-8cef-42a6-991a-1a57bf82fee5","main","cda35bdf-b8c2-4f38-b097-6db9e0397243","loox-product-reviews-app-section","related-products"]}
